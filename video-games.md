# Video Game Setups
## Playnite
[Playnite](https://playnite.link/) is a free, open-source video game library manager for PC. It works a lot like Steam, except you can integrate all of your video game stores (like Epic, Xbox/Game Pass, Ubisoft, etc) so that they can all be managed and launched from a single app. It can also add non-game-store apps (such as those you download off Gameyfin) and can be almost endlessly customized with themes, plugins, and more. One of these plugins is for RomM, the retro game library on the server. Using this plugin along with RetroArch, you can install, launch, and play games directly from the server on your computer. If you set up Sunshine and Moonlight (covered later), you can even stream these games - and any other game on your computer - to a TV and play with a controller.   
Playnite is pretty easy to install - just click on the link above and install it like you would any other program. You can configure your integrations (Steam, Epic, etc) in Menu -> Library -> Configure Integrations. In Menu -> Add-ons (or F9), you can manage your installed Add-ons/Plugins/Themes and browse available ones to install. 

## RomM With Playnite Using RetroArch
So now you have Playnite, but you want to play old retro games from the [RomM Server](romm.taybot.ca) on your computer using Playnite. First, we need to install an app called RetroArch.  
RetroArch is an all-in-one emulator package. It allows you to download, install, and manage any emulator for any system, and the RomM Playnite plugin requires you to have these emulators installed to work properly. Go on over to the [RetroArch Download Page](https://www.retroarch.com/index.php?page=platforms) and download the Stable release. Install this and we'll get started.
### Setting Up Your First Emulator
When you first open RetroArch, it'll bring you to a main menu screen. You can control this with mouse/keyboard or a controller (Xbox controllers work with PCs via Bluetooth and RetroArch maps to them by default). We're going to start by installing the Gamecube emulator, Dolphin. On that main menu page, simply go to Load Core, then on the next screen select Download a Core.  
This will bring up a long list of available emulators you can download. Scroll down until you see Nintendo - GameCube/Wii (Dolphin) and select it. This will download the core/emulator to your computer. That's all you have to do in RetroArch for now! Let's go back to Playnite.
### Adding RomM to Playnite
The instructions that I'm about to break down can be found [here](https://docs.romm.app/4.4.0/Integrations/Playnite-plugin/), but I'll step-by-step them for ya.
1. [Click this link](playnite://playnite/installaddon/RomM_9700aa21-447d-41b4-a989-acd38f407d9f) and Playnite will launch asking you if you want to install the plugin. Do so and restart Playnite.
