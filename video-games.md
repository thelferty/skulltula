# Video Game Setups
## Playnite
[Playnite](https://playnite.link/) is a free, open-source video game library manager for PC. It works a lot like Steam, except you can integrate all of your video game stores (like Epic, Xbox/Game Pass, Ubisoft, etc) so that they can all be managed and launched from a single app. It can also add non-game-store apps (such as those you download off Gameyfin) and can be almost endlessly customized with themes, plugins, and more. One of these plugins is for RomM, the retro game library on the server. Using this plugin along with RetroArch, you can install, launch, and play games directly from the server on your computer. If you set up Sunshine and Moonlight (covered later), you can even stream these games - and any other game on your computer - to a TV and play with a controller.   
Playnite is pretty easy to install - just click on the link above and install it like you would any other program. You can configure your integrations (Steam, Epic, etc) in Menu -> Library -> Configure Integrations. In Menu -> Add-ons (or F9), you can manage your installed Add-ons/Plugins/Themes and browse available ones to install.  
You can really go nuts with customizing Playnite, and there's guides galore on the internet if you do a bit of searching. Their [subreddit](www.reddit.com/r/playnite) also has tons of great resources. Try things out, play around, never touch Steam again (just kidding I still use it all the time).   
In the future, I'll add a section on how to set up Sunshine and Moonlight so you can stream Playnite and ALL of your games (including RomM games) to your TV, or any nearly any other device with a screen.
   
## RomM With Playnite Using RetroArch
So now you have Playnite, but you want to play old retro games from the [RomM Server](romm.taybot.ca) on your computer using Playnite. First, we need to install an app called RetroArch.  
RetroArch is an all-in-one emulator package. It allows you to download, install, and manage any emulator for any system, and the RomM Playnite plugin requires you to have these emulators installed to work properly. Go on over to the [RetroArch Download Page](https://www.retroarch.com/index.php?page=platforms) and download the Stable release. Install this and we'll get started.
### Setting Up Your First Emulator
When you first open RetroArch, it'll bring you to a main menu screen. You can control this with mouse/keyboard or a controller (Xbox controllers work with PCs via Bluetooth and RetroArch maps to them by default). We're going to start by installing the Gamecube emulator, Dolphin. On that main menu page, simply go to Load Core, then on the next screen select Download a Core.  
This will bring up a long list of available emulators you can download. Scroll down until you see Nintendo - GameCube/Wii (Dolphin) and select it. This will download the core/emulator to your computer. That's all you have to do in RetroArch for now! Let's go back to Playnite.
### Adding RetroArch to Playnite
The instructions that I'm about to break down can be found [here](https://docs.romm.app/4.4.0/Integrations/Playnite-plugin/), but I'll step-by-step them for ya.
1. [Click this link](playnite://playnite/installaddon/RomM_9700aa21-447d-41b4-a989-acd38f407d9f) and Playnite will launch asking you if you want to install the plugin. Do so and restart Playnite.
2. Go to Menu -> Library -> Configure emulators (or Ctrl + T). In the resulting pop-up, you want to hit the Import button on the bottom left, then Scan Folder in the next pop-up. Navigate to where you installed RetroArch and confirm with Select Folder. You should see RetroArch added to the import window.

3. Assuming you already installed the Dolphin core in RetroArch like above, you should see Dolphin appear under Built-in profiles on the main Configure Emulators screen. If not, don't panic. Just hit the Add button (the one that's a little higher and centred than the Import Add Copy Remove buttons at the bottom left) and scroll down to "Built-in profile: Dolphin" (NOT Dolphin Launcher). This will add the built-in profile for your GameCube/Wii emulator. The default settings that it brings in are fine. It should look like the picture below (I've already added a couple other emulators. Go ahead and add these too using the same process - first loading them in RetroArch - if you'd like! Beetle is for PlayStation 1 and Mupen64 is N64!

4. Hit the Save button and let's move on to connecting to RomM! In the future, if you add new emulators to RetroArch and want Playnite to pick them up, just go back to this Configure Emulators screen and use the Add button for Built-in profiles (from step 3) to add the built-in profile for the emulator you downloaded. Once that's done, you can go right to adding games from RomM or your own personal library for that emulator (the RomM way detailed in the next section).
### Configuring RomM in Playnite
Next, we're going to configure the RomM plugin to connect to the Skulltula server. Go to Menu -> Add-ons (or F9). In the pop-up window, under Extension settings, expand Libraries and select RomM. In this window, you need the host url (https://romm.taybot.ca) and your username and password that you use to log in to RomM on the server. Then you have to map your emulators.  
Next to that big red X, just double click each box to bring up a dropdown menu for each column and a browser for Destination Path. Fill them in as I have them for your Dolphin emulator, and check the two options at the bottom.    
For the Destination Path, navigate to your RetroArch installation folder and then the downloads folder. In here, create a new folder for your emulator, such as ngc (nintendo gamecube) or dolphin or whatever else you want to call it. This will be where Playnite downloads the rom files (the game files the emulator uses) from the server to run on your computer. **You'll see in the screenshot below that my Gamecube destination path is just the downloads folder, because I didn't realize it wouldn't sort them itself. Don't be me and organize your files better by making folders, like I did for my other two emulators.**

Hit Save and you're done! In the future, you can come back to this same screen and add any other emulators you download, just like the others I've added in the above screenshot.
### Add RomM Games!
Now you can import games from the server! Simply go to Menu -> Update Game Library -> RomM and sit back and let it do it's thing. The import will **only import games you have an emulator configured for**, so whenever you add a new emulator, run the import again to grab those games. If you don't see them, check your filters and select RomM under Library (note: your Playnite might look different from mine in the screenshot below, since I'm using a different theme. If you like it, it's the FusionX theme. I also have Nintendo GameCube in my filters under Platform, which you might not see. This becomes available after you import GameCube games). Install games to download the game rom to your downloads folder you configured in the previous step, then run it and it will load RetroArch and the game.

Now you're playing games like it's 1995! (or 2005, or whatever year those games are from). You can use your controller to play them, and RetroArch should map the buttons correctly out of the box (or does a best guess. It did a pretty good job mapping GameCube button layout to my Xbox controller). You may notice that the games look much more pixelated than you remember - that's because these games were made for small CRT TVs, not 1080p/4K LCD monitors and TVs, so you're seeing all the imperfections that the fuzziness of old TVs kind of smoothed over. In the future, I'll add a section on how to download HD texture packs so they look like brand new! Or you can go ahead and do some googling, there's a LOT of info out there.
