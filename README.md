## Change Log
## 2025.11.14
- Added Kobo Sync functionality to Booklore. Now you can set up Kobo Sync in your Booklore account, which allows you to add books from the library to your Kobo Shelf in Booklore, which will sync wirelessly (both ways) with your Kobo eReader! Guide on how to set it up is [here](/kobo-sync-guide.md)

### 2025.11.06
- Created a change log.
- Replaced Calibre with BookLore. Much more intuitive interface, some great features, and works with the overall Skulltula authentication layer (so you can use your main login that you created with the invite link to access this). Coming soon - Kobo integration!
