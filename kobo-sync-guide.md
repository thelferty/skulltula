# Kobo Sync with BookLore
Booklore has the functionality to wirelessly sync with your Kobo eReader! It even auto-converts books to kepub format, which formats the book better to work with Kobos (so page counts are correct, margins line up, etc). In your BookLore, you will see the main Skulltula Library and also shelves. You can create any shelves you want, but by default you should have a Kobo shelf. Any books in here will sync with your Kobo eReader both ways - meaning if you delete a book from your Kobo, it will remove it from this shelf (but not the library) and vice versa. Setting this up requires some minor configuration, which is described below.

### Setting Up Kobo Sync
Full instructions can be found in [BookLore's Documentation](https://booklore-app.github.io/booklore-docs/docs/integration/kobo/#%EF%B8%8F-step-1-enable-kobo-sync-in-booklore), but below I've given a stripped down step-by-step. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes to set up. If you do follow the BookLore official documentation, in step 2 under updating the API endpoint -> Configuring Options, use Option B: Remote Server Setup (Reverse Proxy), replacing <your-domain> with booklore.taybot.ca.
1. In BookLore, go to Settings -> Devices. At the bottom you'll see Kobo Integration Configuration. Toggle Enable Kobo Sync to On, and you should see more appear, including your Kobo Sync Token. This will at first appear as a bunch of dots, but you can click the eye button to the far right of it to see the actual value and copy it. **If you have finished all the steps in the guide and have Kobo Sync set up on your Kobo, and you hit Regenerate Token on this page, you will have to change the token in the following steps, so avoid this button unless you need to change out your token!**

2. Plug in your Kobo to your computer so that it appears as a file folder you can go into. You should see a folder named .kobo (if it's not there, try showing hidden folders, as it may be hidden). Open this folder and then the Kobo folder. Inside this you should see a file called _Kobo eReader.conf_. Right click on this and Open With -> Notepad (or any other text editor, but Notepad is the best for it). A very complicated looking file will open up. Don't worry about most of this **(and don't change anything else other than the below value! If you accidentally do, just close it without saving and re-open it. If you want to be extra safe, before you open it copy and paste the file to another folder on your computer as a backup)**.
3. What you're specifically looking for is in the section labeled/starting with **[OneStoreServices]**. Three lines down from this you'll see **api_endpoint=https://storeapi.kobo.com**. This is the line you want to update. Change after the "=" so the line reads the same as below, replacing your-token with your Kobo Sync Token copied from Step 1:\
    api_endpoint=https://booklore.taybot.ca/api/kobo/your-token
4. Save the file and close it, then safely eject and unplug your Kobo from the computer.
5. You're all set up! Add books from the Skulltula Library to your Kobo shelf by clicking the 3 dots in the bottom right of the book and selecting Assign Shelf, then select your Kobo shelf. After you add the books you want to your Kobo shelf, on your Kobo simply hit the Sync button and it will sync with that shelf! If you remove books from your Kobo, it will remove them from the Kobo shelf in BookLore when you sync, and if you remove books from the Kobo shelf they will be removed from your Kobo when you sync. Now you can skip downloading books and manually adding them to your Kobo, just throw them on your Kobo shelf and hit sync!
